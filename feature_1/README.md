                          Branch Redirect / Stall / Flush
```

### 5 Pipeline Stages:
1. **IF (Instruction Fetch):**
   - Program Counter register (`pc`) with branch/jump redirection support.
   - Sequential next PC (`pc + 4`).
   - Instruction Memory (IMEM) interface.
   - Stall support: Freezes `pc` on load-use hazards.

2. **ID (Instruction Decode & Register File Read):**
   - Extracts `opcode`, `rd`, `rs1`, `rs2`, `funct3`, `funct7/subtype`.
   - Generates control signals (`alu_op`, `immediate_sel`, `mem_read`, `mem_write`, `mem_to_reg`, `reg_write`, `branch`, `jal`, `jalr`, `lui`, `auipc`).
   - Immediate Generator (I, S, B, U, J types with standard sign extension).
   - 32-entry Register File (x0 hardwired to 0) with **internal writeback-to-decode forwarding** (WB -> ID).

3. **EX (Execution & Address Calculation):**
   - Dual Forwarding Multiplexers (`forward_a`, `forward_b`) selecting between ID/EX register data, EX/MEM forwarding, or MEM/WB forwarding.
   - 32-bit ALU supporting ADD, SUB, SLL, SLT, SLTU, XOR, SRL, SRA, OR, AND, LUI, AUIPC, and return address generation (`pc + 4`).
   - Branch condition evaluation (BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU) using signed/unsigned subtractors with borrow bits.
   - Target PC computation for branches (`pc + imm`), JAL (`pc + imm`), and JALR (`(rs1 + imm) & ~1`).

4. **MEM (Memory Access & Store Data Formatting):**
   - Data Memory (DMEM) interface.
   - Store formatting unit with alignment-aware byte enables:
     * `SB`: 8-bit replicate + 1-hot byte strobe `wstrb` (4'b0001, 4'b0010, 4'b0100, 4'b1000).
     * `SH`: 16-bit replicate + halfword strobe `wstrb` (4'b0011, 4'b1100).
     * `SW`: 32-bit word with full word strobe `wstrb` (4'b1111).

5. **WB (Writeback & Load Formatting):**
   - Formats raw data loaded from DMEM with byte alignment and sign/zero extension:
     * `LB`: 8-bit sign extended.
     * `LBU`: 8-bit zero extended.
     * `LH`: 16-bit sign extended.
     * `LHU`: 16-bit zero extended.
     * `LW`: 32-bit word.
   - Result multiplexer selecting between load data and ALU/jump return result.
   - Drives write port of Register File (`wb_reg_write`, `wb_dest_reg`, `wb_data`).

## 2. Pipeline Registers

Four dedicated pipeline registers isolate the stages:
1. `if_id_reg.v`: Latches `pc`, `pc_plus4`, and fetched `instruction`. Supports `stall` (freeze) and `flush` (clear to NOP).
2. `id_ex_reg.v`: Latches control signals, decoded operands (`rdata1`, `rdata2`, `imm`), and register indices (`rs1`, `rs2`, `rd`). Supports `stall` and `flush` (bubble insertion).
3. `ex_mem_reg.v`: Latches ALU result, forwarded store data, destination register `rd`, and memory control signals.
4. `mem_wb_reg.v`: Latches memory read data, ALU result, `rd`, and writeback control signals.

---

## 3. Hazard Detection & Forwarding Unit (`hazard_unit.v`)

### Data Forwarding:
Resolves Read-After-Write (RAW) data hazards without stalling the pipeline:
- **EX Hazard (EX/MEM -> EX):** Forwarded when `ex_mem_reg_write && (ex_mem_rd != 0) && (ex_mem_rd == id_ex_rs1/rs2)`. Select code: `2'b10`.
- **MEM Hazard (MEM/WB -> EX):** Forwarded when `mem_wb_reg_write && (mem_wb_rd != 0) && (mem_wb_rd == id_ex_rs1/rs2)`. Select code: `2'b01`.
- **Back-to-Back Priority:** EX/MEM is prioritized over MEM/WB to guarantee the most recently computed value is always selected.

### Load-Use Hazard Detection:
When an instruction in EX is a LOAD (`id_ex_mem_read`) and its `rd` matches `id_rs1` or `id_rs2` of the instruction in ID:
- Assert `stall_if = 1` (Freezes Program Counter).
- Assert `stall_if_id = 1` (Holds instruction in ID).
- Assert `flush_id_ex = 1` (Inserts exactly **1 bubble cycle** into ID/EX).
- **Latency penalty:** Exactly 1 clock cycle (matching Section 5 design commitment).

### Control Hazards (Branches & Jumps):
Resolved in the EX stage:
- When a branch condition is satisfied or an unconditional jump (JAL/JALR) executes:
  * Redirects PC to computed target address.
  * Flushes speculative instructions in IF/ID and ID/EX (`flush_if_id = 1`, `flush_id_ex = 1`).
  * **Flush penalty:** Exactly 2 clock cycles (matching Section 5 design commitment).
- When a branch is not taken, execution continues sequentially with **0 stall cycles**.

## 8. Interactive Terminal Pipeline Simulation & Trace Visualizer

A full-system cycle-by-cycle pipeline trace tool is available via `run_pipeline_trace.py`:

```bash
# Run standard compiled C benchmarks with cycle-by-cycle trace:
python run_pipeline_trace.py addition
python run_pipeline_trace.py fibonacci
python run_pipeline_trace.py sort
python run_pipeline_trace.py negative
python run_pipeline_trace.py xor

# Run custom inline assembly instructions:
python run_pipeline_trace.py --asm "addi x1, x0, 15; addi x2, x0, 25; add x3, x1, x2; addi x10, x3, 0; ret"

# Run custom C, Assembly, or Hex file:
python run_pipeline_trace.py custom_prog.c
python run_pipeline_trace.py custom_prog.s
